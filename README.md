# Particle-Predictor
This is a very very simple code to allow for the training of a model in to predict the particle's position when given a time value.
This code uses sysnthetically generated data but if you would want to change the input of data into using your own file, just remove the lines of code that generate synthetic data and add your own input functions.
This is using Python as the programming language and also utilizes the scikit-learn library, using regression techniques mainly a neural network to train the model.
